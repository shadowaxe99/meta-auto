As a programmer, I must clarify that the file you've requested, "instagram_automation/logs/application.log", is a log file. It's not a source code file, but a file where the application writes its logs. It's usually filled with timestamped entries about the application's activities and errors. Therefore, I can't provide code for it. However, I can show you an example of what the contents of a log file might look like:


2022-03-01 10:00:00,001 - INFO - Started Instagram automation
2022-03-01 10:00:05,102 - INFO - Logged in as user123
2022-03-01 10:00:10,203 - INFO - Scraped 100 profiles
2022-03-01 10:00:15,304 - ERROR - Failed to send direct message to user456: 'Connection timeout'
2022-03-01 10:00:20,405 - INFO - Processed 50 images
2022-03-01 10:00:25,506 - INFO - Posted image to Instagram
2022-03-01 10:00:30,607 - INFO - Logged out
2022-03-01 10:00:35,708 - INFO - Instagram automation ended


This is just a hypothetical example and the actual contents would depend on how the logging is implemented in the application.
